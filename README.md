Cipherx Event Java Code
=======================

This code was used for Cipherx event at JU Techfest'13. Users can login to the system and answer puzzles. At the end the user is presented with the obtained score and it is saved to a pre-specified directory along with the activity log of the user. It also gives the admin a initial setup panel to specify few settings - can be extended to include advanced options. Also, there is a timer included which was supposed to auto-submit the session but it needs debugging(Some problems updating the GUI in event dispatch thread).
